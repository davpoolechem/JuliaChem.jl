# Welcome to JuliaChem!
JuliaChem is an electronic structure theory program written in Julia, designed to combine
Julia's dynamic and interactive nature with its high-performance capabilities to offer users the best of both worlds for quantum chemistry computations.

# Building JuliaChem (for Users)
If you are simply interested in using JuliaChem for your calculations, you
can build JuliaChem as follows.

The first step to building JuliaChem is setting up SIMINT. This is needed to
form the JuliaChem/SIMINT interface, currently called Julia Electron Repulsion 
Integrals (JERI). This is done as follows:

1. Download and install SIMINT. Note that SIMINT must be compiled with the 
-DSIMINT_C_FLAGS=-fPIC flag as one of the flag options. Also note that you must
compile SIMINT yourself - the pregenerated version of SIMINT is not compatible with 
JuliaChem. Since JuliaChem only supports up to L shells, though,
you can build SIMINT with only the smaller-AM shells, which greatly speeds
up the process.

2. Define the environmental variable SIMINT as the directory of your
SIMINT installation.

3. Then, the other GitHub dependencies for JuliaChem must be downloaded.
This can be done with the following Julia commands:

a. using Pkg

b. Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/davpoolechem/MATH.jl.git"))

c. Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/davpoolechem/JCModules.jl.git")) 

Finally, JuliaChem itself can be downloaded and installed:

d. Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/davpoolechem/JuliaChem.jl"))

This will download the JuliaChem package to your computer and build JERI.
If all goes well, this should be all that is needed. Now, you can use 
JuliaChem in any script you wish simply by importing the JuliaChem module:

using JuliaChem

# Building JuliaChem (for Developers)
If you are interested in actively developing JuliaChem, you will want to build and 
install JuliaChem as follows.

1. As with above, you will need to build and install SIMINT. This follows the 
first two steps as above.

2. Git clone the JuliaChem repo into your directory and cd into it.

3. Download the necessary dependencies. This can be done by inputting the following commands into
the Julia REPL:

a. using Pkg

b. Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/davpoolechem/MATH.jl.git"))

c. Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/davpoolechem/JCModules.jl.git")) 

4. Next, JuliaChem itself can be set up for development. This can be done in the Julia REPL
by first pushing the ] button on your keyboard, and then inputting the following command into
the REPL:

a. dev .

5. Finally, JuliaChem needs to be built. This can be done by inputting the following
command into the Julia REPL:

a. build JuliaChem

This will build both the JuliaChem package and JERI.
If all goes well, this should be all that is needed. Now, you can use 
JuliaChem in any script you wish simply by importing the JuliaChem module:

using JuliaChem

# Documentation
JuliaChem uses the Documenter.jl package to allow for the generation of its
documentation. Much of the information regarding JuliChem, its usage, and its
inner workings is contained within the documentation. The documentation is
generated by going into the docs/ directory and running

julia make_user.jl

in the shell.
